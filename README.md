**About**

LeedsLinked, the platform I developed as part of a university course at the University of Leeds, serves as a specialized social media network designed exclusively for its students. Central to its functionality is the blog feature, which empowers students to express and disseminate their thoughts, experiences, and insights across a multitude of subjects. This platform is unique in its capacity to nurture a rich tapestry of content, thereby facilitating an ecosystem of intellectual exchange and creative expression. This initiative aligns perfectly with the university's ambition to cultivate a vibrant and interactive academic community.

**Learning Objective**

The core learning objective of this project was to deepen my understanding and practical application of the Flask framework in web development. Specifically, I focused on integrating and manipulating databases with complex relational schemas, implementing both one-to-many and many-to-many relationships, utilizing Flask-SQLAlchemy.

My technical achievements include the development of a comprehensive user authentication system. This system, engineered with Flask-Login, manages user sessions and differentiates between regular and administrative users, enhancing the security and functionality of the web application.

On the client-side, I enriched my technical toolkit by crafting a jQuery script encapsulated within "$(document).ready(function() {...});". This script is adept at configuring AJAX requests, incorporating a CSRF token to secure the data transmission process. It's designed to intercept and process user interactions, specifically on elements tagged with the 'likes' class, thereby capturing essential parameters like post ID, like type, and user ID for dynamic content handling.

The project also served as an advanced learning platform for refining my skills in web styling and layout, leading to a deeper comprehension and more sophisticated application of CSS and HTML. This educational journey not only solidified my technical foundation in these languages but also enhanced my ability to create responsive and aesthetically pleasing web interfaces.
